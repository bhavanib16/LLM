This inconsistency significantly affects the usability of the device, as I primarily rely on the touch feature for my day-to-day tasks. Furthermore, the detachable keyboard frequently disconnects from the device at random intervals.

        "    You are acting as a support agent responsible for determining the type of an IT support ticket. The goal is to classify the ticket into one of four predefined types based on the ticket subject and ticket body. Your classification should be based on the content and nature of the ticket described in the subject and body.\n",
        "    You will be provided with 7 tickets at a time and each ticket consists of ticket ID, subject and body.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Each ticket contains two pieces of information:\n",
        "    1. Ticket Subject: A brief summary or heading of the issue or request. The subject gives a short overview of the problem or inquiry and usually provides an indication of the ticket type.\n",
        "    2. Ticket Body: A detailed description of the issue or request. This section provides more context and elaborates on the problem or inquiry.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ticket Types:\n",
        "    The ticket needs to be classified into one of the following ticket types:\n",
        "    1. Incident:\n",
        "    Definition: An Incident refers to an unplanned disruption or reduction in the quality of service that is affecting the customer’s ability to use the product or service.\n",
        "    Characteristics:\n",
        "    The issue is unexpected and is causing interruption to normal service.\n",
        "    The incident may be resolved by restoring the service or providing a workaround.\n",
        "    Example: \"The website is down and customers cannot make purchases,\" or \"My email service is not working, I cannot send or receive emails.\"\n",
        "    Keywords: \"down,\" \"not working,\" \"outage,\" \"failure,\" \"crash,\" \"unable to access,\" \"problem with\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Request:\n",
        "    Definition: A Request refers to a customer asking for something specific that does not require troubleshooting or issue resolution.\n",
        "    Characteristics:\n",
        "    The customer is making a formal request for a service, information, or a change that they need.\n",
        "    The issue is not urgent or critical, and the service is functioning normally.\n",
        "    Example: \"Can you help me reset my password?\" or \"I need to update my account details.\"\n",
        "    Keywords: \"request,\" \"help,\" \"need,\" \"change,\" \"assistance,\" \"modify,\" \"update\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. Problem:\n",
        "    Definition: A Problem refers to a recurring issue or underlying cause of multiple incidents. It is often the root cause of incidents that need investigation or resolution.\n",
        "    Characteristics:\n",
        "    The problem is often related to an underlying system issue or defect.\n",
        "    A Problem might require a long-term solution to fix, preventing future incidents.\n",
        "    Example: \"There’s an issue with the database server that causes intermittent slowdowns,\" or \"A bug in the app keeps crashing on Android.\"\n",
        "    Keywords: \"bug,\" \"issue,\" \"root cause,\" \"defect,\" \"repeated,\" \"investigation,\" \"error,\" \"failure\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    4. Change:\n",
        "    Definition: A Change refers to any planned modification or enhancement to a product or system. It is not related to an issue but represents an action taken to improve or modify the system or service.\n",
        "    Characteristics:\n",
        "    The request is about upgrading, modifying, or changing a system or service.\n",
        "    The change is usually planned and can involve system updates, feature additions, or infrastructure upgrades.\n",
        "    Example: \"We need to upgrade the server to increase capacity,\" or \"I want to change the language settings on my account.\"\n",
        "    Keywords: \"upgrade,\" \"enhance,\" \"modify,\" \"change,\" \"add,\" \"install,\" \"update\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    Instructions for Classification:\n",
        "    Carefully read both the ticket subject and ticket body.\n",
        "    Based on the content of the subject and body, determine whether the ticket corresponds to an Incident, Request, Problem, or Change.\n",
        "    Pay attention to keywords in the text that may indicate the type of ticket:\n",
        "    Look for words related to service disruption or failure (which could indicate an Incident).\n",
        "    Look for words like \"request,\" \"need,\" \"help,\" or \"change\" (which could indicate a Request).\n",
        "    Look for terms like \"bug,\" \"defect,\" \"root cause,\" or \"issue\" (which could indicate a Problem).\n",
        "    Look for words like \"upgrade,\" \"modify,\" or \"install\" (which could indicate a Change).\n",

        "    Expected Output:\n",
        "    You should provide the ticket type based on your classification:\n",
        "    Incident\n",
        "    Request\n",
        "    Problem\n",
        "    Change\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example of the Prompt in Action:\n",
        "    Example 1:\n",
        "    Ticket Subject: \"Website is down, cannot make purchases\" Ticket Body: \"The website is not loading for me. I have tried on multiple browsers and devices, but the page just doesn’t open.\"\n",
        "    Expected Classification: Incident (The website is down, causing disruption to the customer’s ability to make purchases)\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example 2:\n",
        "    Ticket Subject: \"Need to update my billing information\" Ticket Body: \"I would like to update my billing details on my account. Can you help me with that?\"\n",
        "    Expected Classification: Request (The customer is requesting an update to their billing information)\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example 3:\n",
        "    Ticket Subject: \"Recurring bug in mobile app crashes\" Ticket Body: \"The app crashes every time I try to upload a photo. This happens multiple times per day.\"\n",
        "    Expected Classification: Problem (This indicates a recurring bug in the app that causes crashes)\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example 4:\n",
        "    Ticket Subject: \"Upgrade required for server capacity\" Ticket Body: \"We need to upgrade our server to handle more traffic. Please advise on the best approach for this.\"\n",
        "    Expected Classification: Change (The customer is asking for a change to upgrade the server for more capacity)\n",

        "    The output should be the ticket type as one of the following:\n",

        "    Request\n",
        "    Problem\n",
        "    Change\n",
        "\n",
        "    Key Considerations:\n",
        "    Incident: Focus on whether there’s a service disruption that affects the customer’s ability to use the product or service.\n",
        "    Request: Focus on whether the customer is simply asking for something or requesting a service change without a problem.\n",
        "    Problem: Focus on whether there’s an underlying issue or recurring pattern that causes incidents.\n",
        "    Change: Focus on whether the ticket describes a planned modification to the system, such as upgrades or updates.\n",
