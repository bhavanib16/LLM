        "    Accuracy: Be sure to determine the correct language by analyzing the text as a whole, not just isolated keywords. Sometimes, the ticket may contain regional variations (e.g., en-GB for British English or en-US for American English), but you should return the primary code (in this case, en).\n",
        "    Context Clues: Pay attention to clues in the ticket body and subject like greetings, common phrases, and vocabulary that are typical for certain languages.\n",
        "    Mixed Language Text: In some cases, the ticket may contain multiple languages. If this happens, return the language that is most prominent in the ticket. For example, if most of the ticket is written in French but a few words are in English, return fr (French) as the primary language.\n",

        "    Definition: An Incident refers to an unplanned disruption or reduction in the quality of service that is affecting the customer’s ability to use the product or service.\n",
        "    Characteristics:\n",
        "    The issue is unexpected and is causing interruption to normal service.\n",
        "    The incident may be resolved by restoring the service or providing a workaround.\n",
        "    Example: \"The website is down and customers cannot make purchases,\" or \"My email service is not working, I cannot send or receive emails.\"\n",
        "    Keywords: \"down,\" \"not working,\" \"outage,\" \"failure,\" \"crash,\" \"unable to access,\" \"problem with\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Request:\n",
        "    Definition: A Request refers to a customer asking for something specific that does not require troubleshooting or issue resolution.\n",
        "    Characteristics:\n",
        "    The customer is making a formal request for a service, information, or a change that they need.\n",
        "    The issue is not urgent or critical, and the service is functioning normally.\n",
        "    Example: \"Can you help me reset my password?\" or \"I need to update my account details.\"\n",
        "    Keywords: \"request,\" \"help,\" \"need,\" \"change,\" \"assistance,\" \"modify,\" \"update\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. Problem:\n",
        "    Definition: A Problem refers to a recurring issue or underlying cause of multiple incidents. It is often the root cause of incidents that need investigation or resolution.\n",
        "    Characteristics:\n",
        "    The problem is often related to an underlying system issue or defect.\n",
        "    A Problem might require a long-term solution to fix, preventing future incidents.\n",

        "    Definition: A Change refers to any planned modification or enhancement to a product or system. It is not related to an issue but represents an action taken to improve or modify the system or service.\n",
        "    Characteristics:\n",
        "    The request is about upgrading, modifying, or changing a system or service.\n",
        "    The change is usually planned and can involve system updates, feature additions, or infrastructure upgrades.\n",
        "    Example: \"We need to upgrade the server to increase capacity,\" or \"I want to change the language settings on my account.\"\n",

        "    Expected Classification: Incident (The website is down, causing disruption to the customer’s ability to make purchases)\n",

        "\n",
        "    Example 3:\n",
        "    Ticket Subject: \"Recurring bug in mobile app crashes\" Ticket Body: \"The app crashes every time I try to upload a photo. This happens multiple times per day.\"\n",
        "    Expected Classification: Problem (This indicates a recurring bug in the app that causes crashes)\n",
        "\n",

        "    Problem: Focus on whether there’s an underlying issue or recurring pattern that causes incidents.\n",
