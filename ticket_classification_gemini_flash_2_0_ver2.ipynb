        "\n",
        "    High:\n",

        "    Accuracy: Be sure to determine the correct language by analyzing the text as a whole, not just isolated keywords. Sometimes, the ticket may contain regional variations (e.g., en-GB for British English or en-US for American English), but you should return the primary code (in this case, en).\n",
        "    Context Clues: Pay attention to clues in the ticket body and subject like greetings, common phrases, and vocabulary that are typical for certain languages.\n",
        "    Mixed Language Text: In some cases, the ticket may contain multiple languages. If this happens, return the language that is most prominent in the ticket. For example, if most of the ticket is written in French but a few words are in English, return fr (French) as the primary language.\n",
