        "    Impact on the customer: Is the issue preventing the customer from using the product or service? If yes, it’s likely a High urgency.\n",

        "    Impact on Service: The more critical the issue (e.g., affecting multiple users, service outages), the higher the urgency level should be classified.\n",
